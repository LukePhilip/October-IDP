This project taught me a lot about drawing lines at "random." I know this random generation is a cool skill that will allow me to create fascinating projects later down the line. Throughout this IDP, I used variables, functions, arrays, and loops. I used variables to define terms to refer to them later in functions. I used functions to draw the canvas, and lines. I made my lines through the use of empty arrays. Finally, I used for loops in my code. The overall changes in this project were not too significant, as I was pretty satisfied with what I had. However, I changed the line colors to make the final product somewhat resemble "Starry Night."
